=========================

D3 transitions can also be quite complex. You can attach one to another, apply
delays, timings, easings and listen to transition events. THe demo applies
some of these concepts.

## What to do

Install the packages with `npm install` (or you Node package manager of choice).
Serve the folder with `npm start` (or use yout http server of choice) and visit
localhost on port 8080.
