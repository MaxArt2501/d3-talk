Data visualization with D3
==========================

Slides for a talk about D3. # slides, about 40 minutes.

Originally conceived for the [DevRomagna Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/DevRomagna/) (in Italian) in Imola, 2019-01-17.

Built on top of [P-Slides](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/p-slides)!

## Building

Node.js 10.x is required (actually it could work in Node 8 - haven't checked).

To start the presentation in development mode:

1. Clone the repository;
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run serve`

Or `npm run build` to just build it, then serve `/public` with your HTTP server of choice.

## Tests

... what?
